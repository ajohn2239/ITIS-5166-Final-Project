    <p>This article highlights the thoughts and feelings of LGBTQ+ students attending UNC Charlotte after a compilation of 51 anonymous responses collected over eleven days spanning June 18 to June 29, 2024. Among these responses, most of the people surveyed responded that they felt comfortable expressing their identity openly on campus. Around 45% said they were comfortable expressing their identity in the classroom, such as during group discussions, but around 41% answered that they were neutral or unsure if they felt comfortable or not during class sessions.</p>
        <p>Another curious fact from the survey was that around 60%, or 31 out of 51 students interviewed had revealed that they were not part of any UNC Charlotte-affiliated organizations relating to the LGBTQ+ community, such as “PRISM”, the “LGBTQ+ Graduate Coalition”, or “PLEASE” (Peer leader educators advocating for sexuality education). A group of 16 students out of the 51 said that they were part of these groups and/or attended these events.</p>
        <p>From this we can infer that a lot of UNC Charlotte students feel comfortable expressing their queer identities for the most part, and that a noticeable amount are not fully aware of or do not really utilize UNC Charlotte’s community resources or participate in events held by LGBTQ+ organizations. With the growing student population and push for more education and awareness of LGBTQ+ topics, this may change.</p>
